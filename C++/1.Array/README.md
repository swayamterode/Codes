# Arrays

### 1.[Index Implementation](https://github.com/swayamterode/Codes/blob/main/C%2B%2B/1.Array/1.Index_Implementation.cpp)

#### The above code lets us know how the index of arrays is useful in printing the output of a particular element.

###  2.[Index Implementaion using for loop](https://github.com/swayamterode/Codes/blob/main/C%2B%2B/1.Array/2.Index_Implementation_for_loop.cpp)

####  The above code lets us know how the for loop works when you have to print the array elements repeatedly.
**Syntax for loop**
```C++
for ( init; condition; increment ) {
   statement(s);
}
```
In this code we have used
``` C++
 for (int i=0;i<6;i++)
    {
        cout<<array[i]<<endl;
    }
```
#### This will automatically increment the index value until the Condition becomes false that is `i<6`

### 3.[Index Implementaion using for loop](https://github.com/swayamterode/Codes/blob/main/C%2B%2B/1.Array/3.Index_Implementation_for_loop.cpp)
#### The above code lets us know how the index of arrays is useful in printing the output of a particular element. But this time the syntax for *for loop* is different.
``` C++
 for (int x:array){
    statement(s);
    }
```
#### It will import all the values of the array int x. It will be clear from the below example 
``` c++
 for (int x:array){
    cout<<x<<endl;
    }
```
#### It will import all the values of the array int x. Then it will print each element of the array in a new line.

### 4.[Index Implementaion using for loop](https://github.com/swayamterode/Codes/blob/main/C%2B%2B/1.Array/4.Index_Implementation_for_loop.cpp)
#### Similar example as the above one.

---
### 5.[Index Implementation *float*-using for loop](https://github.com/swayamterode/Codes/blob/main/C%2B%2B/1.Array/5.Index_Implementation_float-using_for_loop.cpp)

#### Similar example as [Index Implementation using for loop](https://github.com/swayamterode/Codes/blob/main/C%2B%2B/1.Array/3.Index_Implementation_for_loop.cpp) but here we have used floating data type.

#### See the code to get a clear idea of how the float datatype works even when the decimal points are not mentioned in the code.
