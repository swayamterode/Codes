        Of all Team China's table tennis stars in Tokyo, Ma Long undoubtedly shone brightest.
    </p>

    <p>The veteran became the first player to claim back-to-back Olympic men's singles titles, as well as the first man to complete two Grand Slams-the treble of Olympic, world championship and World Cup titles in one year.
    </p>

    <p>
    He collected his first gold in Tokyo by outclassing world No 1 teammate Fan Zhendong 4-2 in the final on July 30. Last Friday, "Captain Long" doubled his tally in the Japanese capital by helping the Chinese squad to a 3-0 triumph over Germany in the men's team final.
