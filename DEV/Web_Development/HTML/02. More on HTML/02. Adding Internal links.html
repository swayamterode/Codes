            <h2>About Timo Boll</h2>
            
            <p>
            Timo Boll (born 8 March 1981) is a German professional table tennis player who currently plays with Borussia Düsseldorf and is the German No.2 of the German Table Tennis National League.
            As former No.1 player, he is currently ranked No.9 in the World Rankings as of December 2014.
            </p>

            <h2>Childhood:</h2>
            <p>
            Boll was born in Erbach im Odenwald, Hessen. At the age of four, Boll was playing table tennis and at that time was coached by his father. 
            In 1987 he became a member of TSV Höchst and played there at association level. 
            At the age of eight years he was discovered by Helmut Hampel, a Hessian trainer who promoted him. 
            In 1990, he started to train at the training centre Pfungstadt and four years later changed teams to FTG Frankfurt (de) with whom he took part in the second division, at which time other table tennis associations became interested in him. 
            TTV Gönnern (de) hired him in 1995. Timo Boll was put in position five on the team but, nevertheless, lost only one match in the whole season and thus contributed to the rise of the team in the table tennis national league.
